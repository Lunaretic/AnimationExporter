# AnimationExporter
A simple FFXIV Animation converter/exporter, using the SaintCoinach framework

This project has dependencies on most of the SaintCoinach stuff: https://github.com/ufx/SaintCoinach

It also uses a custom FBX Interop DLL instead of the stock SaintCoinach one, available here: https://github.com/Lunaretic/fbxinterop
